Notes:
- This Manual expects a completed save: all Base Camps unlocked, Rank 10, not limited by consumables.
- You start with one region unlocked, but a fast travel location for each region. The warp alone doesn't unlock the region!
- Pokémon often can be found in multiple regions, they only have to be caught once.
    - Each static Alpha has their own location when enabled. These also count for the normal catch location.
- Climbing cliffs with Wyrdeer is not considered in logic.
- Using Wyrdeer to jump the river to the south island in Crimson Mirelands is difficult without 
  accidentally triggering Basculegion, but it is in logic to give Wyrdeer locations to unlock.
- Swimming Pokémon logically require Basculegion, even if they could be caught from land.
- Space-Time Distortions are in logic with their items. Check your Pokédex to see what's available without them.
- Mass outbreaks are only considered for shiny logic. They are a progressive item for each region, unlocking mass outbreaks, then massive mass outbreaks. Don't use them for normal locations if ignoring logic is discouraged in your game.
- You can catch Pokémon in fights, but you shouldn't do this to go out of logic.
